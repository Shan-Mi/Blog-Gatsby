Lucky enough to be able to get some help from amazing Lukas, when we kinda got stuck on how to implement testing for conditional rendering and different behavior.

Then the rest part testting for another file took me at least 3 hours to find out some solutions (still uncertain if I did it right or wrong).

We are definitely going to redo our test...sigh...
